            <p style="font-size: 20px;">
                Android is an open-source operating system based on Linux with a
                different programming languages like Java , Kotlin or Dart interface for mobile devices such as
                Smartphone (Touch Screen Devices who supports Android OS)
                as well for Tablets too. Android was developed by the Open Handset Alliance,
                led by Google, and other companies. Android was developed by the Open Handset Alliance (OHA), which is
                led by Google. The Open Handset Alliance (OHA) is a consortium of multiple companies like Samsung, Sony,
                Intel and many more to provide services and deploy handsets using the android platform.
                In 2007, Google released a first beta version of the Android Software Development Kit (SDK) and the
                first commercial version of Android 1.0 (with name Alpha), was released in September 2008.
                In 2012, Google released another version of android, 4.1 Jelly Bean. It’s an incremental update and it
                improved a lot in terms of the user interface, functionality, and performance.
                In 2014, Google announced another Latest Version, 5.0 Lollipop. In Lollipop version Google completely
                revamped the UI by using Material Designs, which is good for the User Interface as well for the themes
                related. All the source code for Android is available free on Git-Hub, Stack overflow, and many more
                websites.
                Google publishes most of the code under the Apache License version 2.0.

            <p style="font-size: 20px;">
                The android is an operating system and is a stack of software components which is divided into five
                sections and four main layers that is
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Linux kernel
                </li>

            <h2 style="font-size: 25px;">Why Develop Apps for Android?</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">Developers create apps for a variety of reasons. They may need to
                address business requirements or build new services or businesses, or they may want to
                offer games and other types of content for users. Developers choose to develop for Android
                in order to reach the majority of mobile device users.</p>

        <section>
            <h2 style="font-size: 25px;">Why to Use Android?</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">
                a) It is the most popular platform for mobile apps.
                As the world’s most popular mobile platform, Android powers hundreds
                of millions of mobile devices in more than 190 countries around the world.
                It has the largest installed base of any mobile platform and is still
                growing fast. Every day another million users power up their Android-powered
                devices for the first time and start looking for apps, games, and other digital content.
                <br><br>b) Best experience for app users
                Android provides a touchscreen user interface (UI) for interacting with apps. Android’s
                UI is mainly based on direct manipulation. People use touch gestures such as swiping,
                tapping and pinching to manipulate on-screen objects. In addition to the keyboard, there’s
                a customizable on-screen keyboard for text input. Android can also support game controllers
                and full-size physical keyboards connected by Bluetooth or USB.
                <br><br>
                c) It’s easy to develop apps
                To develop apps that take advantage of the Android operating system and UI, developers can use the
                Android software development kit (SDK). The SDK includes software libraries of prewritten code,
                a debugger, a device emulator, documentation, sample code, and tutorials that help to easily
                develop an android app. The design feature for XML pages instead of writing code helps a lot to
                boost the confidence of beginners in the android application development.
